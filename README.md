Using the Facebook Marketing API to help you target audiences more effectively and optimize Facebook Ad campaigns

## Motivation
If you use Facebook Ads Manager to search for targatable interests, you (and everyone else) only see 25 suggestions for each interest you type in. This means that everyone is targeting the same interests. However there are many more interests on the Facebook Marketing API that are not shown on Facebook Ads Manager. This tool displays the API results on a user-friendly interface, meaning that you can target interests that no one else is targeting.
