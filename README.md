Using the Facebook Marketing API to help you target audiences more effectively and optimize Facebook Ad campaigns

## Motivation
This project came about as a way to make running ad campaigns on Facebook more efficient and cost-effective. It does this by showing you a much wider range of possible audiences to target. 

If you are searching for audiences to target on Facebook Ads Manager, you've probably noticed that whatever interest you type in, you're only shown 25 suggestions. This is a problem because first of all, it stops you finding more niche audiences, and secondly, because everyone sees the same 25 suggestions it means you are competing with them which pushes your costs up. 

Even though Ads Manager only shows you 25 suggested interests, there are actually loads more you can access through the Facebook Marketing API. 

The basic idea of this project is to take these API results and display them in a user-friendly way, along with some other useful features such as being able to save interests and add them to projects. 

With this tool you can discover new audiences and target interests that no one else is targeting.

## Coming soon...
The project is still not complete. Features that I'll add in the future include:
- The ability to create projects and add interests to them, so you can keep track of your saved interests more easily.
- The possibility to see more info about interests you have used in the past.
